# OSTW Helper Functions
This repository is for short code that can be dropped into existing OSTW codebases.

Code here should be 
1. **single-purpose:** it should do one thing very well (e.g. a library for subscribeable events, or a macro that applies a smoothstep to a number between 0 and 1)
2. if necessary, **well-documented:** if something is long or the logic is not immediately obvious, it should be accompanied with explanations
3. **Your own** or **shared with permission**: pull requests made to this repo should contain code that you have express permission to share
